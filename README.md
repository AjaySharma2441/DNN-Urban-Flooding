# DNN-Urban-Flooding
Deep Neural Network is used to classify the urban flood risk area within the three cities (Bhagalpur, Varanasi and Patna)
Training sample were taken from the Patna on the basics of flood which took place on September, 2019.

main.py = complete code of DNN for Urban Flood:
test_data = Data used for training and testing:
Output = Output data for Varanasi.

About CSV data-
Parameters used:
Slope = Slope,
DEM = Digital Elevation Model,
DS = Distance from Sewerage Network,
DI = Distance from Industries,
Drainage= Drainage Density,
GWL = Ground Water Level,
DR = Distance from River,
LULC = Land Use Land Cover,
Pop_Density = Population density
Rainfall = Rainfall,.
DRd = Distance from Road

In this all hte spatial datas were converted into csv data then classification is perform over csv data and output is generated in csv format.Further this csv data is converted into spatial for to show the spatial distribution of risk map.
